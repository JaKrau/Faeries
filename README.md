# Welcome to My Weather Dashboard

## Description

I built this weather dashboard so I can search for today's weather and get a five day forecast for any city in the world. 


## Installation

git clone git@github.com:JaKrau/Faeries.git

## Usage

The site features a search bar, a search history section, and a display area for your desired city's weather and five day forecast. 
Type a city name into the search bar and hit enter, or click the search button, to see the weather display appear. 
The cities you search will be stored locally and appear in the search history section, each city appears as a button which you may click to see the weather forecast appear.
